# Project Name

Redux Feedback Loop Application

## Description

For this project, I was tasked with creating a feedback application that is modeled after Prime's Feedback app. This application needed to consist of 4 seperate pages that collect information, and then a summary and confirmation page. To construct this application, I used react, redux, created routes for each page, and then created a database for the information to be posted to upon submitting.
